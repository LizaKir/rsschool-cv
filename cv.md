## About myself

My career connected with sciene - biotechnology, genetic engenering, bioinformatics and etc. Programming was interesting for me since i studied in school in 9-11 grades. 

I really like technologies, science, learn something new and read about new discoveries. The last one was about drugs against first type of diabetes mellitus by FDA. 

We create models if proteins molecules, energetic and methabolic pathways, no matter in what or who - humans, mushrooms or bacterias. We were do researches about dissemianted intravascular coagulation syndrom and COVID-19. Every week we tried to grow a new microorganism, do some experiments with it, add substances in it to see what will happen. 

But, if even i like it, like to be a part of it, now i don't think this is better way for me. In my country science has a last place.
I'm not a creative person, so UI/UX design is boring for me, my ideas are not interesting or correct. Don't have enought imagination for that.
Web Development, being a Frontend Developer is more attractive for me. I have ready model or prototype of web-site, ladning-pafe or even just button and should only codding. I prefer to find ways now translate designer's ideas to computer code, learn how it works, not how harmoniously combines colors, gradients, form or somethinh else.

I think Web Development can give me a lot of possibilities for growth, emotions and, i hope, career and stable future in this unstable time By the way, "A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step".
